        <ul>
            <li>Zucchini: Of course, you’ll 
                need zucchini! Two large zucchini should 
                make enough for eight servings. </li>
                <li>Seasonings: This zucchini lasagna is seasoned with salt, pepper, fresh basil, fresh oregano, and fresh parsley. </li>
                <li>Beef: This recipe calls for ground beef, but you can use ground turkey for a lighter take. </li>
                <li>Fresh produce: Aside from the zucchini, you’ll also need a green bell pepper, an onion, and mushrooms from the produce aisle. </li>
                <li>Frozen spinach: Frozen spinach is a convenient, colorful, and nutrient-rich ingredient. </li>
                <li>Tomato products: A combination tomato paste and tomato sauce. </li>
                <li>Wine: Red wine enhances the overall flavor. </li>
                <li>Cheese: You’ll need low-fat ricotta cheese, mozzarella cheese, and Parmesan cheese. </li>
                <li>Egg: An egg adds moisture and helps bind the ricotta mixture together, preventing runniness.</li>
            </ul>
